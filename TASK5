TASK 5: CNOT Gate and Quantum Teleportation
Aim
To implement, simulate, and verify the functionality of the Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and demonstrate the quantum teleportation protocol using Qiskit.

1. Mathematical Model of the CNOT Gate
The Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is a two-qubit gate where the second qubit (target) is flipped only when the first qubit (control) is in state 
.
It performs the following transformations:

The CNOT gate is used in quantum circuits for entanglement generation and error correction mechanisms.

2. Mathematical Model of Quantum Teleportation
The quantum teleportation protocol allows transmission of an unknown quantum state from one qubit to another distant qubit using entanglement and classical communication.
The general steps include:

Preparation of Entanglement:
An entangled Bell pair 
 is created between the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob).

Bell Measurement:
Alice performs a joint measurement on her qubits to project them onto one of the Bell states.

Classical Communication:
Alice sends the two classical bits from her measurement results to Bob.

Unitary Operations:
Based on the received bits, Bob applies corrective operations (
, 
, 
, or 
) to recover the original quantum state.

Mathematically, the teleportation process transfers an arbitrary state 
 from Alice’s qubit to Bob’s qubit without physically sending the qubit itself.

3. Algorithm – CNOT Gate and Quantum Teleportation
Initialize three qubits:

Qubit 0 holds the state to be teleported.
Qubits 1 and 2 form an entangled Bell pair.
Apply a Hadamard (H) gate to qubit 1 and a CNOT gate between qubits 1 (control) and 2 (target) to generate entanglement.

Apply CNOT between qubits 0 (control) and 1 (target), followed by a Hadamard (H) gate on qubit 0.

Measure the first two qubits and send the classical outcomes to the receiver.

Apply corrective gates on qubit 2 according to the classical results:

If the first bit is 1, apply 
.
If the second bit is 1, apply 
.
Verify that the final state of qubit 2 matches the original input state 
.

Measurement results:

4. Result
The experiment successfully demonstrated the implementation, simulation, and verification of the CNOT gate using Qiskit, followed by the construction of a complete quantum teleportation protocol. The simulation validated the correct operation of the CNOT gate by observing the expected transformations of all possible input states.

The quantum teleportation circuit accurately transferred an arbitrary quantum state from Alice to Bob using entanglement and classical communication. The results confirm that the protocol enables the faithful reconstruction of the original qubit at Bob’s end, illustrating one of the most fundamental applications of quantum information theory.
