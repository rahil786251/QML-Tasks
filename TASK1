TASK 1: Born Rule for Measurement Probabilities
Aim
To compute measurement probabilities of quantum states using the Born rule.

Procedure
Quantum software development involves designing algorithms and applications that run on quantum processors (Qubits).
Several software development kits (SDKs) and platforms have emerged to support quantum programming, such as:

Qiskit (IBM Quantum): Python-based SDK supporting quantum circuit design, simulation, and real hardware execution.
Cirq (Google): Focuses on near-term quantum algorithms and hardware integration.
PennyLane (Xanadu): Integrates quantum computing with machine learning workflows.
TensorFlow Quantum: Converts classical layers into quantum-based learning circuits.
Amazon Braket: Provides cloud-based access to multiple quantum hardware providers.
Steps Followed
Define quantum superposition states.
Apply the Born rule to compute measurement probabilities.
Normalize the computed probabilities.
Visualize results using bar charts for comparison between quantum states.
The Born rule states that the probability of measuring a state 
 from a quantum state 
 is given by:

For example, for a superposition state 
 
,
the measurement probabilities for 
 and 
 are both 
 
.

psi_2 = np.array([1/np.sqrt(3), np.sqrt(2/3)]) # Custom superposition

TASK 1: BORN RULE - MEASUREMENT PROBABILITIES
==================================================
Superposition state 1: |ψ₁⟩ = [0.70710678 0.70710678]
Measurement probabilities: [0.5 0.5]
Superposition state 2: |ψ₂⟩ = [0.57735027 0.81649658]
Measurement probabilities: [0.33333333 0.66666667]

Result
Hence, the measurement probabilities for two different quantum superposition states were successfully computed and visualized.
The results confirmed that the probabilities were normalized and matched theoretical expectations based on the Born rule.
